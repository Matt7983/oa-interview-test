# Problem

You are planning an online admissions system, it will  allow teachers to follow student to see this student's latest activities. 

please provide the following 3 APIs to implement the feature:

1. Teacher can follow a student.
2. Teacher can unfollow a student.
3. Can list specific teacher's followed students.

### Note:

You can define model attributes freely, all we want is the follow/unfollow feature. If you can make it more like real world feature that's welcome.


## Requirements

- Response is rendered in JSON format.
- Unit testing your APIs.
